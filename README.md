## **Attributions**
This app leverages several libraries and resources:
- **Axios** for making API requests.
- **React Router** for handling client-side routing.
- **MongoDB Atlas** for cloud database hosting.
- **Font: EB Garamond** from Google Fonts, used to style the app with a classic serif font

## **Technologies Used:**
### **Frontend**:
- **React.js**: The primary framework used to build the user interface.
- **React Router**: Used for routing between pages like Menu and Checkout.
- **Axios**: For API calls to the backend for fetching menu items and managing the cart.
- **CSS**: For styling, including custom variables and responsive design.
- **JWT Authentication**: Token-based authentication to ensure secure user sessions.

### **Backend**:
- **Node.js and Express**: Server setup for handling routes like user login, menu item retrieval, and order management.
- **MongoDB with Mongoose**: NoSQL database to store user data, orders, and menu items.
- **JWT for Authentication**: Used to authenticate users on login.

## **Next Steps:**
- **Cleanup Frontend**: Clean up the frontend making it more visually coherent and structured.
- **User Profile Management**: Allow users to create and manage profiles, view order history, and favorite menu items.
- **Advanced Cart Features**: Enable users to modify item quantities in the cart directly from the menu.
- **Order Customization**: Allow customers to customize items before adding them to their cart (e.g., adding toppings, sauces, etc.).
